        <h4>Engaging Stakeholders</h4>
        <p>
          As part of its Alliance/Movement Building Strategy, AGE
          has consistently involved the community stakeholders
          including the local council chairman and other community
          leaders in each and every step of its projects.

          This has, over
          the years, ensured that the participation of the community is
          full-fledged in all our activities and the communities feel a
          sense of ownership to the project
